# Learning SAP
I have spent some time learning about SAP with the help of tutorials in order to learn about SAP as a technology

## Developing a Business App Using SAP Business Application Studio
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/appstudio-cap-app.html

In this tutorial, I learned how to build a simple Node.js application using the SAP Cloud Application Programming (CAP) model. The application I developed is a basic bookshop management app, with a focus on data modeling and service integration. The code for this tutorial can be found [here](/CAP-NJS/).

Key things I learned:

- Creating a CAP Project
- Defining a Data Model
- Exposing Services
- Adding Custom Logic
- Testing the CAP Application

## Create an Application with SAP Java Buildpack
https://developers.sap.com/tutorials/btp-cf-buildpacks-java-create.html 

In this tutorial, I learned how to develop and deploy a Spring Boot application on SAP BTP (Business Technology Platform) using the SAP Java Buildpack and the Cloud Foundry Command Line Interface (cf CLI). The project involves setting up a simple web application, configuring services, and securing the app with authentication and authorization mechanisms. The code for this tutorial can be found [here](/java-tutorial/).

Key things I learned:

- Creating a Spring Boot Java Project
- Deploying an Application using Cloud Foundry in the SAP BTP environment
- Authentication and Authorization with XSUAA
- Using the Cloud Foundry CLI

## Aquiring Core ABAP Skills

In this extensive guide, I developed a strong foundation in ABAP programming on SAP BTP. The course covered everything from setting up the environment to building applications using the ABAP RESTful Application Programming Model (RAP). The code for this tutorial was developed on a SAP BTP cloud platform, because of that it is not available in this repository.

Key things I learned:

- Setting Up the ABAP Environment
- ABAP Basics
- Managing internal tables
- Object-Oriented ABAP
- Database Interaction
- CDS views
- ABAP RESTful Programming Model (RAP)

This course gave me hands-on experience in ABAP development, from basic concepts to creating applications on SAP BTP.
